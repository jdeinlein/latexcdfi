  abstract  = {Over a decade ago, Katja Mueller proposed a new method for locating settlements in the Fayum borrowed from the social sciences: multidimensional scaling (MDS). As is so often the case with pioneering research, it was heavily criticized, although she never claimed the technique would overcome all problems associated with locating lost sites. In this paper, I suggest an alternative approach to MDS, based on network analysis, to detect settlement communities. In the past 13 years the database that Mueller started from has greatly expanded, allowing for a more encompassing analysis. Narrowing down the possible location radius of unknown sites with the help of these methods can be valuable for studies of ancient settlement patterns.},

  abstract  = {The first Latin translation of a collection of monks’ stories is published here in a text-critical edition. They were originally written in Greek by bishop Palladius ca. 420 CE, who was commissioned by Lausus, a high official at the court of Constantinople under Emperor Theodosius II. The Latin form of the text of the first edition, which is presented with an introduction, is the basis of the version edited by H. Rosweyde as an appendix to the Vitae Pa-trum (printed in Migne, PL 74, 243-342). It has a text-critical apparatus, an apparatus of biblical passages and similies, as well as several indexes.},

Thus the Ignatian spirituality proves the nowadays often assumed dichotomy between spirituality and polies to be a false one. For Ignatius, a spirituality proves ist truthfulness and usefulness when the same principles guide both spiritual and political discernment.]},

Following the innovative thesis of Adam Seligman (et al.) that modernity's tendency to embrace the mode of sincerity needs the counterweight of a subjunctive as if mode of ritual, this essay offers conceptual thoughts on the denial of ritual as it relates to modernity's mode of sincerity and its absolutizing truth-claims. In the first part, I turn to modalities of political violence as extreme forms of sincerity, in which a professed anti-ritualistic impulse is at work in the service of legitimation and justification. In the second, and shorter, part, I propose a counter-practice to the rhetorical operations that deny ritual in the name of sincerity. Attentiveness to the creative playfulness of the subjunctive orientation points to a ritual practice that engenders a symbolic reality of seriousness without falling into the trap of absolutizing boundaries.]},

Arguing against this dichotomy, the following contribution builds upon research on "implicit knowledge" (Michael Polanyi) and "knowing how" that allow us to view body and mind in their interaction. The focus is on Simeon Stylites the Elder, the most prominent representative of the Syrian ascetic movement, who, in a spectacular way and after incessant exercise, was able to act from a sphere of internalized body-knowledge. Selected texts on him dating from Late Antiquity will illustrate how the ascetic body was represented as a body of knowledge with which the idea of Christian perfection was to be fulfilled.]},

Amid a contradictory collection of narratives and advice, the Sayings leaves the reader to find in his or her particular life the lack or desire that prompts him or her to approach the other in repentance and yet in hope. The Sayings points to this sort of faith as much as to deconstructive questioning-both of which take place in this "desert in the desert"-as constitutive of right relations with the other.]},

The central question in this article is: how does Athanasius show himself to be a mystagogue in his Vita Antonii? It is shown that the monastic formation process, by which Athanasius represents Anthony's life, comprehends five stages. At the first two stages the fear of God's judgement is the driving and purifying force in the ordo vitae. In the third and fourth stages, Athanasius formulates the first aim of his mystagogy: the restoration of Adam's original state of the soul, marked by imperturbability and serenity. During the fifth and last stage, however, the teacher is faithful to the directives that were taught to him at the very beginning of his monastic life. Now, however, ascesis is not inspired by the fear of the Lord but merely by the love of Christ.]},

It argues that the major problem facing members of the Order of Hermits of Saint Augustine ({OESA}) was how to appropriate the tradition of the desert fathers and that of Augustine's monasticism for the tradition of the Order. In this light, special attention is given to the Pseudo-Augustinian Sermones ad fratres in eremo and the central importance of John Cassian and Paul of Thebes. Of particular importance are the works of Jordan of Quedlinburg, which shaped the identity of the {OESA} from the mid-fourteenth to the early sixteenth century. The desert fathers provided the model of the eremitical life, and thus Jordan "mythified" the desert fathers as he had Augustine himself. This was not an issue of historical identification, but of mythic creation in an attempt to provide the foundation of the late medieval {OESA}.]},

House ascetics in cities survive for us in documentary and other sources, but women monks in non-coenobitic, nonurban environments are more difficult to locate, to the point at which some scholars have begun to question their very existence. This essay seeks to change the parameters of the scholarly debate over the nature of non-coenobitic female monastic experience. It examines hagiography, monastic rules and letters, and documentary papyri to reassess the state of the field and to produce a fuller portrait of anchoritic and semi-anchoritic female asceticism. Non-coenobitic women's monasticism existed, and it crossed boundaries of geography and social status, as well as the traditional categories of lavra, eremitic, coenobitic, and house asceticism. This interdisciplinary approach provides insights not only into women ascetics' physical locations but also into their class, education, and levels of autonomy. An intervention into the historiography of women's asceticism in late antique Egypt, this study ultimately questions the advisability of using traditional categorizations of "anchoritic," "lavra," and "coenobitic" to classify female monasticism, because they obscure the particularities and diversity of female ascetic history.},

Jesus, the Essenes, and Christian Origins sheds new light on this old question by reexamining the complex relationships among Qumran, the historical Jesus, the Essenes, and Christian origins within first-century Palestinian Judaism.Author Simon J. Joseph’s careful examination of a number of distinctive passages in the Jesus tradition in light of Qumran-Essene texts focuses on major points of contact between the Qumran-Essene community and early Christianity in four areas of belief and practice: covenant identity, messianism, eschatology, and halakhah (legal interpretation), placing the weight of his argument for continuity and discontinuity on the halakhic topics of divorce, Sabbath, sacrifice, celibacy, and violence.Joseph focuses on the historical, cultural, chronological, and theological correspondences as convergence. This not only illuminates the historical Jesus’ teachings as distinctive, developing and extending earlier Jewish ethical and halakhic thought, it also clarifies the emergence of early Christianity in relationship to Palestinian Essenism. By bringing this holistic analysis of the evidence to bear, Joseph adds a powerful and insightful voice to the decades-long debate surrounding the Essenes and Christianity.},

This chapter employs philological and source-critical analysis to show that their argument is based on faulty presuppositions and suffers fatally from internally inconsistent logic. It is argued that the Greek text as it has been reconstructed by André-Jean Festugière approximates the anonymous author’s autograph, notwithstanding of course minor and ultimately inconsequential variant readings resulting from scribal errors and interventions which crept into the text over the centuries of its transmission.},
